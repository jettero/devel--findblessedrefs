=head1 NAME

Devel::FindBlessedRefs - find all refs blessed under a package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Devel::FindBlessedRefs qw(:all);

    my @refs = find_refs("PackageName");
    # this is somewhat inefficient and is probably only useful for testing

If you're so inclined, you could also search this way:

    use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);

    my @refs;
    find_refs_by_coderef(sub {
        my $sv = shift;

        if( ref($sv) and blessed($sv) ) {
            push @refs, $sv if $sv->isa("PackageName");
        }
    });

I am using this software in my own projects...  If you find bugs, please
please please let me know. :) Actually, let me know if you find it handy at
all.  Half the fun of releasing this stuff is knowing that people use it.
