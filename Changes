1.253: Fri May 06 2011
   - fixed a couple typos.  renamed find_refs_with_coderef

1.252: Wed Mar 25 16:22:38 EDT 2009
   - added chorny's META.yml stuff

1.251: Sun Oct  5 09:38:38 EDT 2008
   - removed the other SvTYPE() since it's probably also wrong

1.25: Wed Sep 10 07:01:39 EDT 2008
   - woops: http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=709036 --
     applies to this code also

1.2: Thu Aug  7 16:13:58 EDT 2008
   - removed version.pm and Module::Build

1.1.3: Wed Jul 30 07:26:31 EDT 2008
   - just noticed my email address was wrong in the pod
   - removed the Makefile.PL, it causes problems

1.1.2: Wed Jul 23 16:11:58 EDT 2008
   - Module::Build needs ExtUtils::CBuilder to build XS
     (lame)

1.1.1: Tue Jul 22 07:06:54 EDT 2008
   - moving to Build.PL so version.pm will work correctly with
     XS.  Sad.

1.1.0: Fri Jul 18 07:29:44 EDT 2008
   - added a by_coderef version of find_refs

1.0.6: Mon Jun 16 19:56:37 EDT 2008
   - That was a stupid idea and I can't believe I posted it to
     CPAN.  After I thought about it more, the error: "object
     version undef does not match bootstrap parameter" --
     indicates that the .so has "undef" as the version string,
     not the other way around.  So the MakeMaker is screwing this
     up, not the XSLoader.
   - Hehe, rigged.  I set the 01_load.t to spew interesting
     details from the Makefile on failure.

1.0.5: Mon Jun 16 17:58:45 EDT 2008
   - I brainstormed that I can eliminated the qv() problems on
     some platforms by interpolating the $VERSION... probably
     won't work.  Worth a shot.

1.0.4: Tue May 27 12:12:28 EDT 2008
   - (wow, use version has to be on the same line as our $VERSION
      for older EUMM)

1.0.3: Mon May 26 15:46:29 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.0.1: Sat May 24 09:45:24 EDT 2008
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig

1.0.1:  Fri Aug 18 16:21:57 EDT 2006
   - I've been told by two respectable coders that my standard
     old GPL+comments license is silly.  It is.  I'm switching to
     the LGPL.  :(

1.0.0:  Fri Aug 18 16:21:57 EDT 2006
   - I got this working
